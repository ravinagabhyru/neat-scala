  * This class serves as a way to record innovations

  * Are the same innovation, they can both be assigned the same innnovation number.
  * This class can encode innovations that represent a new link
  * forming, or a new node being added.  In each case, two
  * nodes fully specify the innovation and where it must have
  * occured.  (Between them)
